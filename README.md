Customer Segmentation is crutial for every business to keep customers satisfied, and to develop personalized products and services. Companies need to understand the customers data better in all aspects. Detecting similarities and differences among customers, predicting their behaviours, proposing better options and opportunities to customers became very important for customer-company engagement.

The main objective of this project is to segment customers into groups on basis of common characteristics in order to improve loyal relationships with customers through better understanding of their needs and to develop customized marketing campaigns.
